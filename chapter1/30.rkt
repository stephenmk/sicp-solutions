;;; Exercise 1.30.
;; The sum procedure above generates a linear recursion. The procedure
;; can be rewritten so that the sum is performed iteratively. Show how
;; to do this by filling in the missing expressions in the following
;; definition:

(define (sum term a next b)
  (define (iter a result)
    (if <??>
        <??>
        (iter <??> <??>)))
  (iter <??> <??>))

;;; Solution
(define (sum term a next b)
  (define (iter a result)
    (if (> a b)
        result
        (iter (next a) (+ result (term a)))))
  (iter a 0))

;; Tested and works with the Simpson procedure defined in the previous
;; exercise.
